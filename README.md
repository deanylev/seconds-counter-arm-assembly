# **Seconds Counter**

This is a pretty simple ARM assembly program that counts from 1 - 9 on a seven-segment display and allows a button to switch the counting direction. It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with the required components connected to GPIO.

The code itself is very amateur and does not utilise some of the more advanced ARM assembly features. This was part of a computer engineering class I got approval to do, I'm actually studying computer science ðŸ™‚
